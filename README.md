# Creating interactive maps and cartograms with R and Javascript

This is the repo for a blog post which is part of the _Communicating the findings of long-term care research_ series for the [Data Science Interest Group](https://goltc.org/interest-group/data-science/) of the [Global Observatory of Long Term Care](https://goltc.org/). The actual blog post can be viewed [here](https://goltc.org/wp-content/uploads/r-charts/GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post.html).

## Reproducibility

This blog post is created using public data and can reproduced. You will need [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package. This will ensure you have the required version of the R packages contained in the [`renv.lock`](./renv.lock) file.

To reproduce the blog post from the original data, `git clone` this repo and run the R file [`./1__create_html_from_qmd.R`](./1__create_html_from_qmd.R). This will:

1. Ensure that you have `renv` and the required version of the R packages installed.
2. Recreate the US election map and cartogram at the start of the blog post. These are the only maps which are not created within the html file, as generating a population-weighted Dorling cartogram of all US counties takes about 15 minutes.
3. Generate the html file from `GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post.qmd`, using the versions of the R packages set out in `renv.lock`. The `renv.lock` contains the R dependencies and versions. The Quarto version is [`1.4.268`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/tag/v1.4.288).

The output will be:

1. `GoLTC--maps-cartograms-blog-post.html`. This is the actual html file.
2. `./GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post_files/`. The folder with the javascript dependencies.

### Additional feature: Create a minimal html file

The html file generated by Quarto hardcodes the data in it, meaning it is quite large (10mb). To mitigate this, I have also included a Python script, `3__remove_hardcoded_data.py`, which generates a much smaller html file by removing the hard-coded json data from the html file into a subdirectory. It adds some JS into the html which then loads the data when the page is loaded. In more detail, the steps are:

1. Remove all the `<script src = "*.js">` tags from the `<head>` of the html, storing the URLs to be loaded after the data in step 4 (to avoid the issue on load where there is no data to parse).
1. Find the JS in `<script>` tags hardcoded into the body of the html and move the code to separate \*.js files to be loaded in step 4 (to prevent errors caused by loading them before the scripts which had been loaded in the `<head>`).
1. Remove the hardcoded map (and any other `htmlwidgets`) json data from within the `<script type="application/json">` tags and save to separate json files in a `./page_files/data/` folder.
1. Insert a JS script into the `<head>` which uses [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) with chained `.then()` statements to do the following (in this order):
   - Inject the relevant data from each json file back into the html.
   - Dynamically load the scripts that were in the `<head>`.
   - Dynamically load the scripts that were in the `<body>`.
   - Render all elements with [`HTMLWidgets.staticRender()`](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets/blob/943a819bf1a6cc705a6d0efe99fbf38f13e6bc50/inst/www/htmlwidgets.js#L570).

The additional output will be:

1. `GoLTC--maps-cartograms-blog-post_min.html`. A much smaller html file (166kb rather than 10mb).
2. `./GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post_files/libs/`. Additional JS scripts which were hardcoded into the html.
3. `./GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post_files/data/`. A new folder with the json data which was previously hardcoded.

To view the file as it appears on the web, move the html file and the `./GoLTC-maps-cartograms-blog-post_files` subfolder to a public or local web server (e.g. Node [live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or Python [SimpleHttpServer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-simplehttpserver-http-server)). Your web server should have the following file structure:

```

```

If you do the additional step of creating a minimal html file, there will also be some additional JS scripts in that folder and a `./libs/data` folder.
